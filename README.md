-----------------MUSIC PLAYER--------------
---------------by Owens Ehimen -------------

REQUIREMENTS:
The system (Music Player) should be able to:
- Add songs into music libraries
- Search for songs in libraries
- Simulate a song being played
- Create albums and add songs into the albums
- Create playlists and add songs into the playlists
- Add albums and playlist into the libraries


ARCHITECTURE:
This application was developed using a combination of tools from Java and Umple. The simulation of a song being played was developed with state machines on Umple while the classes were developed using class diagrams on Umple.

The system is incomplete because of time constraints givenon this assignment, meaning it does not have the capability to:
- Play songs in albums in the order they were added
- Play songs in playlists in the order they were added
- [BONUS] shuffle songs in the library and play in the order

A class diagram for the classes and state diagram for the simulation
are both included in this repository, as well as a demonstration of how this system works.
